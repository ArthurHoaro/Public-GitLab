# Reporting issues

If you have issues with Public GitLab, you can report them with the Github issues module.

Please rememberer to privide as much information as you can (e.g. which database you are using).

Disclaimer: I do not provide any support on GitLab itself. I only contribute to the _public part_. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/README.md) for any help on GitLab itself.

If there is a new stable branch, please do not open an issue to ask update. Contact me instead.
