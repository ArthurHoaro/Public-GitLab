Disclaimer: I do not provide any support on GitLab itself. I only contribute to the _public part_. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/README.md) for any help on GitLab itself.

If there is a new stable branch, please do not open an issue to ask for an update.  [Contact me](http://hoa.ro/static6/contact) instead.
